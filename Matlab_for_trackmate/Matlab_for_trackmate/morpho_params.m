%%%% AIM %%%%%
% To add morphological parameters to each point of each Trackmate track

%%%% INPUTS %%%%
 %      - Frames for each timepoint of the current file to analyze
 %      - Tracks associated to the analyzed file

 %%%% PROCESSING %%%%
%       - The tracks are formatted as a table 'tracks'. Lines correspond to
%       a given point in space and time. Columns correspond to the timestep
%       between a current point (x,y,t) and the next one (x,y,t+timestep),
%       the X coordinates, the Y coordinates, the ID of the track
%       - For each frame of the analyzed file, the centroid and
%       morphological parameters of each immune cell are extracted in a
%       table 'morpho'
% Then,  each line of 'tracks' is associated to a line of 'morpho' by
% finding the line in 'morpho' having the closest (x,y) coordinates than
% the given line of 'tracks'
